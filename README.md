# MindMap

Welcome to MindMap! This project is designed to [insert a brief description of what your project does, e.g., "create interactive mind maps for brainstorming and visualization"]. Below are instructions to get started with cloning the repository and setting up the environment.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) (Anaconda or Miniconda)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
To get a local copy of the project, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wesliejh/mindmap.git
cd mindmap
```

### 2. Create a Conda Environment
Set up a virtual environment using Conda to manage dependencies:
```bash
conda create -n mindmap python=3.9
conda activate mindmap
```
Replace python=3.9 with your preferred Python version if different.
